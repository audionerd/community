    The OPEN SOULS Soul Engine is a hosted service and collection of typescript libraries to create mind blowing experiences with AI souls.

    The Soul Engine offers developers clean, simple, and extensible abstractions and APIs for directing the cognitive processes and mental state of large language models (LLMs), steamlining the creation of more effective and engaging AI souls.

    The Soul Engine is built on top of our open source [core library](./core.mdx). It offers multi-model (and multi-modal) access, vector search, and a variety of other APIs available as straightforward react-style hooks in your own codebase. Your code is then executed and hosted by the engine (think Vercel, and so much more, for AI souls).

## ðŸ’« AI Souls
AI Souls are agentic and embodied digital beings, one day comprising thousands of mental processes (managed by the Soul Engine). Unlike traditional chatbots, your code gives digital souls personality, drive, ego, and will.

## Quick Start

[Join our discord](https://discord.gg/opensouls) to get access to the service.


1. Clone our community repository to explore example souls.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opensouls/community
```

2. Run Samantha Soul
```bash
# then CD into the samantha-learns example soul.
cd community/souls/samantha-learns
# and npm install
npm install
# and then run samantha
npx soul-engine dev
```

Those commands will open your web browser and you can chat with samantha. Explore the code to get a quick idea of how to customize your own soul.

3. Init your own soul
```bash
npx soul-engine init bob-roasts-milenials
```

That will create a blank soul 'Bob' and off you go creating your experiences.
