# Echo listens to discord

**Soul Designer:** [@tobowers](https://github.com/tobowers)

Echo is more of an example soul than anything else, to illustrate how one might hook up discord and the soul engine and debug that interaction.

## Run this soul

Edit the .env (see .env.example)

In this directory run

```bash
npx soul-engine dev
```

```bash
bun run discord/index.ts
```
